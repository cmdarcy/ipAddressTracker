## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
-   Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

-   [Regular-Expressions.info](https://www.regular-expressions.info/ip.html/) - This helped me create the validation regex for ip Address checking.
